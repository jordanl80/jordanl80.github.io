    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>My name is Jordan Lewis and I teach Math and Engineering
    (including CSP obviously) at Shafter High School in Shafter California
    I also coach cross country and track and field.  In my off time....wait,
    I don't have any.  So yes, teaching and coaching takes up most of my time
    </p>
    <p>I am also a big sports fan.  Since I coach cross
    country and track, I am a fan of any level of running.  Beyond that, I also
    enjoy football, basketball, and baseball.  I generally enjoy watching any 
    sport, but there are the ones that I have teams that I root for.</p>
    <p>Here is a list of my favorite teams</p>
    <ul>
      <li>San Francisco 49ers</li>
      <li>California Angels (yes I know they have another name but it's dumb</li>
      <li>Baylor Bears</li>
      <li>Golden State Warriors (more recent but not a bandwagon)</li>
    </ul>
